		<p>The second dish I chose is Mac and Cheese. I have liked to 
		eat mac and cheese since I was very little. It has been my
		favorite food my whole life ans there are very few mac and 
		cheese recipes that I dislike. My favorite way to eat it is
		definetly homemade. My family often has homemade mac and cheese 
		on thanksgiving or christmas. We also find ourselves eating it
		for dinner on random days of the week sometimes. My mom who 
		doesn't really like mac and cheese likes this recipe and says
		that "it tastes high quality."</p>

		<h2>Tips/Substitutions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are not a big fan of elbow
				macaroni, you can use a different kind of pasta.</li>
			<li>I would recomend hand-grading the blocks of swiss and
				chedder cheese as it inhances the flavor of the
				sauce more than bagged, pre-shredded cheese.</li>
			<li> It is always a good idea to taste it as you go 
				as you may decide that it needs more of a specific ingredient.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid of seasoning! It may come as a suprise 
				but the addition of the salt and pepper can 
				really enhance the flavor of the mac and cheese.
				Add a little, stir it, and try it to make sure 
				there is enough.</li>
			<li>If you like a different kind of cheese like parmasean,
				you can add that in to your liking.</li>
