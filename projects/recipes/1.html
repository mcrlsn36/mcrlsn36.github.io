		<p> The recipe I chose was the Seven Layer Cassorole. My family 
		and I have been having this for dinner for a couple months now. 
		We started off having it for dinner on normal days and we still 
		do but over time we have started making it for guests and
		family members. It is a good dish to make for people who come
		over because it has a lot of different components so if someone
		doesn't like a specific food, there are other parts of the dish
		they may enjoy. Last summer, we made it for my aunt who doen't
		eat meat. Because it is a dish that we can easily adjust to
		dietary restrictions, we were able to make her portion without
		meat and she still expressed to us that it was "A very
		delicious meal." I think it is a convienient dish because a lot
		of the ingredients are things you can find pre packaged in 
		cans, boxes, or bags at the grocery store. It is time efficiant 
		and all you have to do is warm up those ingredients and add
		them to the cassorole. Overall it is a somewhat recent addition
		to my family's meal plan and we enjoy having it.
