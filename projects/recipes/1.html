		<p> The recipe I chose was the Seven Layer Cassorole. My family 
		has been having this for dinner for a couple months now. 
		We started off having it for dinner on normal days and  over
		time we have started making it for guests and family members as
		well. It is a good dish to make for people who come over
		because ithas a lot of different components so if someone 
		doesn't like a specific food, there are other parts of the dish
		they may enjoy. Last summer, we made it for my aunt who doen't
		eat meat. Because it is a dish that we can easily adjust to
		dietary restrictions, we were able to make her portion without
		meat and she still expressed to us that it was "A very
		delicious meal." I think it is a convienient dish because a lot
		of the ingredients are things you can find pre packaged in 
		cans, boxes, or bags at the grocery store. It is time efficiant 
		and all you have to do is warm up those ingredients and add
		them to the cassorole. Overall it is a somewhat recent addition
		to my family's meal plan and we enjoy having it. </p>

		<h2> Tips/Substitutions</h2>
		<ul> 
			<li>In my family, we use a non-stick pan to make the
				beef in, so if you also use a non-stick pan,
				you don't need to use olive oil before cooking
				the beef because it will not stick to the pan.</li>
			<li>Another substitution my family
		makes is that we often use more than a heaping tablespoon of
		taco seasoning. It may sound like a lot, but sometimes the 
		flavor can get a little lost.</li>
			<li>I would reccomend tasting the 
				seasoning after stirring it in and adding more
				accordingly.</li>
			<li>In my family, we don't really eat green chiles so we usually
				leave that out.</li>
			<li>We also like to use sweet corn instead of
				fir-roasted corn.</li>
			<li>You can customize the ingrediants to you and
				your family's likings as well as leave some ingredients out.</li>
